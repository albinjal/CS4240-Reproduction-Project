# Blog post for Deep Learning course

## Introduction
Here we add some motivation about why we chose this paper in the first place.

In this paragraph we explain the paper shortly -> what it does and tries to achieve.



## Building the VQGAN from Scratch (AVI)
Explain briefly what a VQGAN is and the architecture behind it.

Add some code from your implementation on it. Also add PyTorch Lightning -> PyTorch.


## Running the Paper's VQGAN + Transformer on old data
Explain how to run the original code on the old dataset. Also explain why COCO and the motivation.

Show images generated.


## Running the Paper's VQGAN + Transformer on new data
Motivate why the Atari data.

Show images generated.



## FID Scores
Add table for FID scores.


## Conclusion
Conclude the paper -> they can actually make images, but we cannot recreate exact results due to computational power (lack thereof).
